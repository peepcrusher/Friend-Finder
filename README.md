# Friend-Finder



## Purpose

Friend Finder is a full stack application that takes in user data from a survey and returns a new friend that is the closest match to the user's answers. Its purpose is to connect people to that they can be friends. The same general idea is used on some dating websites.  


## 

The survey asks for your name, a link to a picture of yourself, then asks you for 10 questions. Client side javascript then grabs ahold of your answers, and sends a post request to the server. The serverside Javascript then takes your answers, and compares them to every person before you who has taken this survey. Once the server has processed your request, it will send the information back and be displayed in a modal popup.
